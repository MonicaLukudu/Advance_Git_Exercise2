Most values in JavaScript have properties, with the exceptions being null and undefined. Properties are accessed using value.prop or value["prop"]. Objects tend to use names for their properties and store more or less a fixed set of them. Arrays, on the other hand, usually contain varying amounts of conceptually identical values and use numbers (starting from 0) as the names of their properties.
